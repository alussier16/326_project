I was tasked to work on the data modelling, init.py and the addfriends template. I contributed by attending the team meetings and 
discussing how to better design the data model.

I was working on init.py and the addfriends template and was struggling with it and thankfully my team members stepped in 
as they were able to complete them in a shorter amount of time.
