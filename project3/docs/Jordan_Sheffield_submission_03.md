This Project I contributed to the Add Friends html/forms aspect. I worked hard to figure out how to not only search for a user and add them but how to add them with the additional aspect of a friend code that is needed to add the user. I often reached out to my group memebers whenever I felt stuck but the majority of the time I would find my own errors on my own and would not need the help. I completed the task a little later than wanted, but it was a great experience working through all of my errors and getting the results I wanted and needed.

I communicated with my team mates often as to ensure that they knew I was working hard and diligently to complete the task on time. I hope they are happy with my work on this project. In addition to creating the form for the add friends page, I updated a few design aspects on the htmls of certain pages to create a united theme that spanned all the pages. This project was a lot better for me than the last one and I hope my group members and I can finish up little things here and there to maximize our projects efficency
