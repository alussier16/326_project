For this project, I was mostly responsible for creating forms, specifically for comments, posts, and partially reactions. For the comments, I made a simple form that parsed the content of the comment text box on the website. The content in the text box was saved in the content of the comment form, and all other fields (i.e. username, author, timestamp) were saved based on the context of the post. The comment is saved to a specific post pk # so each set of comments is attached to one specific post.

Secondly, I worked on post and reaction forms. These were done very similarly to the comments, explained above. However, we wanted posts to be in a separate window so there is more focus on what you are creating. This involved an extra step - url mapping. The post is added to the current list of posts for the specific user creating it. This was done similar to how comments was done, parsing post data with username (same as author) and timestamp. Reactions were done similarly, except they are only a button press. Because we only have 4 different reactions, I updated the reaction value accordingly to what was pressed. Luckily, our team already made javascript methods to calculate the reaction bar percentages, so not much more was needed.

Finally, I made small tweaks to the front-end to make the new form data appear more fitting. This involved styling the comment box, the reaction buttons, and the post page. It was simple tweaks but it made for a more cohesive appearance.
