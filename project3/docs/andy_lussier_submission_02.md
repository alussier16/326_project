For this project, I was mostly responsible for improving our UI. On our main page, I added many @media fields and updated our divs to be a block display so that our website would be responsive and therefore mobile-friendly. As the window is resized, text size changes accordingly, divs stack, and some widths update dynamically. Beyond this, made many stylistic changes to the main page layout.

In addition to improving UI style, I also made the HTML more template-friendly. For instance, I added a new javascript element attached to the "comments" button next to posts. This will reveal the comments and reactions on click. Reactions are based on a "reactVal" tag that is new in the reaction HTML. This reactVal tag works with our javascript method to dynamically size the reaction bar and also works well with our template for reactions because we are able to feed the template directly from our HTML.

Lastly, I created the templates for a few different pages. In the post.html template, I replaced our previously static comments, posts, reactions, and users with faker data. Even though it is fake data, this allows a post history for users, a comment and reaction history for posts, and a friend list for users. This is partially done through models but processed through the templates that I made.
