I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I worked to implement the user authentication and set up the login and ensured it worked properly with our application in addition to helping check we hadn't missed anything in the templates that improperly showed data from the newly implemented Django user model.

In addition, I wrote the code for the sign up form in forms.py which creates new users in our application. I edited the sign-up template as necessary to implement the form. I also edited the signup view in views.py to receive the form data and used it to create a new User model and our associated extension of the user model called UserAccount which it then saved to the database.

Lastly, I wrote the vast majority of the team write up which gave the overview of our application and outlined changes since the last submission. It also gave the design overview of which I wrote the majority but referred other people to write the specific portions they specifically implemented. I also wrote the Successes/Problems portion and added the basic information about our team choice but also asked for team members looking ahead in advance to implement the team choice to add more detail.
