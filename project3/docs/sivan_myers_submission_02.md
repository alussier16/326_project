I contributed to several aspects of this project. Specifically, I wrote the init.py and init.sh scripts to create mock data and the admin account for the Django application. I also edited admin.py to register any remaining models and made changes as necessary to the models themselves to ensure they worked properly when creating mock data. Afterwards, I checked to make sure the models were working properly within the admin account and the init.py was creating mock data of the models properly and representative of how our application would be.

In addition, I redesigned the "Ties" page of our UI and added blocks as necessary to render mock data in the template. I made changes as necessary to views.py to provide the necessary context to properly render the "Ties" page. I also ensured the page was rendering the mock data correctly by cross checking with the admin page, and that links to other urls were properly directing from the page to the account page.

Lastly, I wrote the vast majority of the team write up which gave the overview of our application and outlined changes since the last submission. It also gave the design overview of which I wrote the majority but referred other people to write the specific portions they specifically implemented. I also wrote the Successes/Problems portion. Additionally, I helped design the data model with the entire team and tried to help other team members troubleshoot implementation problems when possible.
