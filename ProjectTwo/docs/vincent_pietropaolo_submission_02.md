I made a number of contributions to this project. First, I was responsible for Step 0 of Project 2 so I initialized the Django architecture. Then, I created the UserAccount model in models.py and registered it in admin.py. 

Later, I set up the views in views.py so that all of our pages would link properly to each other, and I moved the HTML files we made in Project One to templates and edited them to work with these views. I then changed the post template to display mock poast data rather than hard-coded examples by creating variables in the post view function and passing them into the template using the view function's return statement. I also changed the implementation of the account url in urls.py to make it possible to view the account of any user, while previously a user could only view their own account. 

Lastly, I helped with making the video demonstration portion of the project. Throughout the project I also reviewed the work of some of the other team members and suggested a few revisions if I found problems. Overall I made many contributions to the team, mostly on the back-end, thoughout several different stages of the project.
